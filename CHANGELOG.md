# Changelog

## [1.7.1] - 2026-09-27

### Improvements

- **New-note settings page**: the "New note" sub-page now sits at the settings root as a sibling of "Search" instead of being nested inside it.
- **New-note button pre-fill**: clicking the button with text in the search bar pre-fills the note name (and focuses the folder field), same as the Enter shortcut.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the logo not showing on mobile: the logo SVGs were sized through `calc()` in their `width`/`height` attributes, which WebKit ignores — the auto-sized SVG could collapse to zero. Sizes now use inline CSS, which every engine supports.
- Fix the particle glow having no effect on mobile: the bloom used the canvas `filter: blur()`, which WebKit does not support. The glow is now a downsample/upsample bloom that works on every engine.

### 改进

- **新建笔记设置页**：「新建笔记」子页面从「搜索」中移出，与「搜索」平级显示在设置根层。
- **新建按钮预填**：搜索框有文字时点击「新建笔记」按钮，文字会预填到弹窗的笔记名称中（并聚焦文件夹输入框），与回车快捷方式行为一致。

### 修复

- 修复移动端 logo 不显示：logo SVG 的尺寸写在 `width`/`height` 属性的 `calc()` 里，WebKit 不解析，自动尺寸可能塌缩为 0；现改为所有引擎都支持的内联 CSS 尺寸。
- 修复移动端粒子辉光无效：泛光使用的 canvas `filter: blur()` 在 WebKit 上不受支持；现改为降采样/放大泛光，所有引擎均可用。

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-26

### Features

- **New-note button**: the search bar gains a "new note" button. It can execute a command instead (with a command picker), pre-fill a default folder (with a folder picker), and quick-create on unmatched search names — the button lights up and Enter opens the create dialog with the typed name.
- **Periodic notes**: daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly notes under the search bar. Configuration is read from the Periodic Notes / Daily notes plugins or defined as custom rules; missing notes show a "+" badge and are created on open, honoring folder and template placeholders. Display names support the file name, fixed period text, or custom text with live date placeholders (e.g. `{{MM}}月{{DD}}日`).
- **Vault stats**: an optional files/notes/attachments/folders/tags summary near the bottom of the home tab, with drag-and-drop ordering in the settings and clickable stats that focus the matching search filter (or open the tag pane).
- **Bookmarks sub-page**: bookmarks move their settings into a sub-page, gain a filter input and group filtering, and the sections' Tab focus chain now spans search → periodic notes → bookmarks → recent files.
- **Collapsible sections**: the bookmarks and recent-files sections can be collapsed, individually remembered; collapsed sections are skipped by the Tab focus chain.
- **Platform-aware particles**: the canvas scale setting is now per platform (desktop/mobile), and touch devices get a tap-burst particle interaction instead of the cursor ripple.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the image filter missing `webp`/`avif` files, and unify the suggestion dropdown limit on the existing "search results" setting.
- Fix suggestion dropdowns flickering during fast IME (Chinese input) composition and stacking when switching filters.
- Fix periodic notes opened from the list Enter key and the context menu not being shown (they were only created/resolved); the menu titles are now localized.

### 新增

- **新建笔记按钮**：搜索栏新增「新建笔记」按钮，可配置为执行指定命令（带命令选择器）、默认创建文件夹（带文件夹选择器）；搜索无匹配时按钮高亮，回车直接用输入的名称打开新建弹窗。
- **周期笔记**：搜索栏下方显示日/周/月/季/年记，配置自动读取 Periodic Notes / Daily notes 插件，也支持自定义规则；未创建的笔记带「+」角标，点击时按文件夹与模板占位符自动创建。显示名称支持文件名、周期文字或带日期占位符的自定义文本（如 `{{MM}}月{{DD}}日`，设置页实时预览）。
- **库数据统计**：主页下方可选显示 文件/笔记/附件/文件夹/标签 统计，设置页支持拖拽排序，点击统计项可聚焦对应的搜索过滤器（标签则打开标签面板）。
- **书签子页面**：书签区设置移入子页面，新增筛选输入框与分组过滤；各区块的 Tab 焦点链贯穿 搜索框 → 周期笔记 → 书签 → 最近文件。
- **区块折叠**：书签与最近文件区块支持折叠并分别记忆；折叠的区块会被焦点链跳过。
- **平台化粒子画布**：画布缩放设置按平台（桌面/移动）分别记忆；触屏设备改为点击触发粒子迸发，替代光标涟漪。

### 修复

- 修复图片过滤器漏掉 `webp`/`avif` 文件的问题；建议下拉数量统一跟随现有「搜索结果数量」设置。
- 修复快速输入法（拼音）组合期间建议下拉反复闪烁、切换过滤器时下拉叠加的问题。
- 修复周期笔记通过回车或右键菜单打开时不显示（此前只创建不打开）；菜单标题已支持本地化。

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-24

![Harbor Tab particle effect](docs/harbor-tab-particles.webm)

### Features

- **Recovery speed**: a new slider in the particle interaction settings controls how fast a disturbed particle settles back home — i.e. how long the ripple keeps waving after the cursor passes. Lower values keep the wave lingering; higher values snap back almost instantly.
- **Gradient particle colors**: the old Monochrome toggle becomes a color mode with Monochrome and Gradient options. Gradient mode blends two colors and supports three display effects.
- **Particle glow**: particles can now glow, with an adjustable strength (0 disables it).
- **Idle motion frequency**: the frequency of the idle particle motion can now be adjusted.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the cursor ripple settling at different speeds depending on the display refresh rate.

### 新增

- **扰动恢复速度**：粒子交互设置组新增滑块，控制粒子被光标扰动后回归原位的快慢，也就是鼠标划过之后涟漪能持续多久。
- **渐变粒子颜色**：原「单色」开关升级为颜色模式，可选单色或渐变色。渐变模式混合两种颜色，支持三种显示效果。
- **粒子辉光**：新增辉光功能，可以让粒子发光，强度设置为0则不启用。
- **待机运动频率**：现在可以调整待机粒子运动的变化频率。

### 修复

- 修复粒子涟漪的收敛速度随屏幕刷新率变化的问题。

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-22

### Compatibility

- **Plugin renamed to Harbor Tab** (`harbor-tab`): the `first-light` id is already taken in the official plugin store, so the submission continues under a new id. The repository moved to `Moyf/harbor-tab` (old links redirect automatically); BRAT users switching from a previous install should point it at the new repo. Obsidian treats the new id as a different plugin — enable it and re-configure its settings once; the old `first-light` folder can be removed from `.obsidian/plugins/`. The lighthouse wordmark/icon is unchanged

### Bug Fixes

- Fix "ghost" home tabs: after closing a tab, the new-tab replacement could target a detached leaf and resurrect it outside the layout tree, leaving stray empty tabs and stale leaf references that other plugins tripped over. It now verifies the leaf is still attached and falls back to the most recently used empty tab
- Fix the search suggestions' keyboard scope leaking when "hide on blur" is disabled: after the search bar lost focus, arrow keys and Enter kept being captured by the stale suggestion list (e.g. Enter re-opened the highlighted result instead of editing). The list stays available for mouse clicks, but the keyboard is released

## [1.4.2] - 2026-09-14

### Compatibility

- **Plugin renamed back to First Light** (`first-light`): development continues in this repository, `Moyf/first-light`. If you previously installed the Home Tab Plus builds, Obsidian treats this as a different plugin — enable it and re-configure its settings once; the old `home-tab-plus` folder can be removed from `.obsidian/plugins/`. Install links point to `Moyf/first-light`.

### Features

- Recent files keyboard navigation now supports Home/End to jump straight to the first/last entry

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the particle wordmark rendering as a solid black dot-matrix on displays with a fractional device pixel ratio (e.g. 225% scaling): pixel sampling now reads whole pixels, so transparent areas no longer fill with particles and the logo/title keep their proper colors
- Fix a phantom horizontal scrollbar showing on the home tab whenever the particle effect is enabled: the particle canvas is scaled wider than the wordmark and centered on it, and its transparent margin used to extend the view's scrollable area; it is now clipped at the pane edge, leaving vertical scrolling untouched

### Improvements

- Icon pickers (logo icon, starred-file icons) now source their suggestions from Obsidian's official icon registry (`getIconIds()`) instead of a hardcoded list of ~830 icon ids, so the suggestion list always matches the icons available in the running app version: newly added icons appear automatically, icons Obsidian does not ship are no longer offered, and custom icons registered by other plugins can be picked and render correctly

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-31

### Features

- Add an "Idle motion" dropdown to the particle effect with six ambient movement modes for the resting wordmark: **Wave rhythm** (a diagonal wave sweeping across the title), **Gentle float** (the whole wordmark bobbing together), **Staggered float** (a standing wave where neighbouring regions rise and fall out of phase), **Heartbeat** (a lub-dub pulse radiating from the center outward, with the amplitude growing toward the rim), **Ripple** (ring-shaped waves spreading from the center) and **Breathe** (a slow uniform radial expansion). All modes are disabled by default ("None") and run at draw time only — the cursor-ripple physics stays untouched, sine lookups use a precomputed table, and "None" keeps the original code path

## [1.3.2] - 2026-08-30

### Features

- Add an "Individual margins" toggle for the logo: when enabled, the four sides (top / right / bottom / left) can each be tuned separately; when disabled (default), the single uniform margin applies
- Move "Logo scale" to the top of the Logo layout settings group

### Bug Fixes

- Fix the particle wordmark occasionally not refreshing after settings changes: logo position, logo scale and logo margins are now part of the rebuild signature (previously only detected when the container happened to resize), a tripped rebuild circuit breaker now retries after a cooldown instead of dropping the pending change, and a rapid-settings race no longer tears down the freshly built engine

## [1.3.1] - 2026-08-30

### Compatibility

- **Plugin id renamed** from `home-tab-plus` to `first-light`: the 1.3.0 release still shipped under the old id. After updating, Obsidian treats this as a different plugin — re-enable it and re-configure its settings once; the old `home-tab-plus` folder can be removed from `.obsidian/plugins/`. Install links now point to `Moyf/first-light`.

### Features

- Add logo position and margin settings for the wordmark area, with dedicated i18n entries
- Add a selection highlight sub-page at the end of Appearance, with i18n entries
- Recent files navigation now loops: continuing past the last entry wraps back to the search bar
- Widen particle effect slider ranges (spacing 1–8, dot size down to 0.2) and tune defaults to a finer lattice

### Bug Fixes

- Fix suggester popovers being trapped behind popout windows: suggestion popups now render in the focused window, and settings-page suggesters (font / icon / image) migrated to the official `AbstractInputSuggest`, which positions itself correctly in popout settings windows
- Fix the particle engine resolving `devicePixelRatio`, computed styles and canvas resources from the main window instead of the window hosting the view (popout-safe)
- Fix a startup race that could wipe stored recent files before they were loaded
- Keep home tab leaf positions across plugin reloads: `onunload` no longer detaches the plugin's leaves
- Fix logo icon color falling back to `currentColor` when no custom color is set
- Bake the computed `stroke` of logo SVGs into the rasterized image so particle icons keep their color (CSS variables do not resolve in standalone SVG images)
- Style the native color input used by declarative settings rows, and re-render the page when a color mode dropdown changes so the custom color picker appears

### Improvements

- Resolve all Obsidian plugin review lint findings: explicit types instead of `Function`/`any`, no `@ts-ignore`, `app` passed explicitly to file utils, `window.`-prefixed timers and animation frames, `createEl` helpers, removal of deprecated `setDynamicTooltip` and of global `app` access (also fixes a latent crash in unresolved-link path resolution)
- Drop unused dependencies (`builtin-modules`, `fs-extra`, `dotenv`)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-30

### Features

- Add an interactive particle wordmark effect: render the logo and title as a dot grid that ripples around the cursor, with a monochrome mode (luminance-shaded single hue) and tunable parameters (canvas scale, particle spacing, dot size, disturbance radius/strength)
- Organize settings into native sub-pages (Search / Logo / Title style / Particle effect) with the declarative settings API
- Rebrand the plugin as **First Light**
- Modernize the settings tab with the Obsidian 1.13 declarative settings API (`getSettingDefinitions`)
- Add a plugin icon (`house`) to the settings sidebar
- Add i18n support with English and Simplified Chinese locales (`getLanguage()`-based)

### Improvements

- Fix typos and apply sentence case to setting names ("Show shorcuts" → "Show shortcuts", "Debug Mode" → "Debug mode")
- Split combined control rows (logo, title font, colors) into one-control-per-row layout

### Compatibility

- Raise minimum Obsidian version to 1.13.0 (required by the declarative settings API)

## [1.2.3] - 2026-05-08

### Features

- Add dedicated icons for canvas, base, and database file types (`LayoutDashboard` / `Table` / `Database`)
- Add `.base`, `.components`, `.xdb` as recognized file types in the lookup table
- Add search filter support for the Recent Files section
- Support jumping to headings directly from search results
- Display alias and title matches in search suggestions
- Add hide-on-blur setting

### Improvements

- Improve fuzzy search ranking and match analysis
- Optimize sorting scores for search suggestions
- Improve suggestion item handling and lower match threshold for better recall
- Optimize heading display in suggestions

### Bug Fixes

- Fix keyboard event cleanup by calling `destroy()` in `homeView.onClose()`
- Fix key mapping issues for keyboard navigation
